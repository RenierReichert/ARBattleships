This is an AR, multiplayer, multi-platform game I made.
It was made using Unity, along with the Photon and and Vuforia packages.

To try it out for yourself, you will find a PC version and an android version in the Demos folder, along with a screenshot of the gameplay.
The android version requires an android API of version 8.0 or higher.

Most of the code can be found in Assets > Scripts
